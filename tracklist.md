Who am i? What am i? am i meant to be here? 
maybe im a mistake. a glitch in the system. 
maybe i'm exactly where i should be. maybe not. 
maybe i'm making it more acceptable for everyone to be themselves + feel how they want to feel. 
maybe i stopped someone somewhere from committing suicide. 
auto correct doesn't finish the word suicide. 
maybe someone is taking a screenshot of this 
+ texting it to a friend because they think i'm crazy 
+ they want to laugh about it. 
this is probably filled with typos + bad grammar. 
i'm paranoid. i'm overwhelmed. 
i smile sometimes. i frown sometimes. 
i'm being honest.
